First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 

All types of contributions are encouraged and valued.

- Join the [Value4Value.chat](http://Value4Value.chat)!
- Have complaints or ideas? [Track an issue!](https://github.com/V4V-info/V4V-info.github.io/issues)
- Logo or design improvements? Show us what you got in an [issue](https://github.com/V4V-info/V4V-info.github.io/issues) or [PR](https://github.com/V4V-info/V4V-info.github.io/pulls)!
- Feel free to [edit the document](https://demo.hedgedoc.org/KAiSh_3KQrSeVydW8L9zJg?both#). We'll monitor the doc for changes periodically, and if they make sense we'll update the site!
- If you know your way around Jekyll and markdown files, [pull requests](https://github.com/V4V-info/V4V-info.github.io/pulls) are always welcome!

For now, anyone can [edit the doc](https://demo.hedgedoc.org/KAiSh_3KQrSeVydW8L9zJg?both#). If that doesn't work we'll have to restrict access and figure something else out.

## Code of Conduct

Resist the urge to be an asshole.
