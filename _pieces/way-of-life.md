Value4Value is more than a monetization scheme; it's a lifestyle. It's a
mindset of abundance and fairness, a new way of looking at valueâ€”value in
general, but digital value in particular.

It is hard to put a finger on the V4V lifestyle, but one could summarize it as
follows:

- No expectations
- No entitlement
- No bullshit

It is a trust in the universe and its people, a trust that if you produce something of value, people will find it valuable and give back. If you [ask them][ask], that is.
