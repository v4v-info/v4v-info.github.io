There isn't one content format when it comes to value-for-value. That being
said, when it comes to podcasting, including your listeners into the feedback
and content-creation loop is tried and tested.

By including your audience into [the feedback loop][loop] you create something
that is bigger than yourself, something *participatory* and *reciprocal*.

From shout-outs to numerology, and honors to badges, a multitude of things can
be added to your content in creative ways that include your audience into the
content creation process directly.
