If you find it valueable, you give value back—in the form of time, talent, or
treasure. That's all there is to it, really.


- **Time**: Your time & attention are valuable. Spending them is valuable in and of itself.
- **Talent**: It doesn't have to be money. Whatever your skills, there are many ways to give back.
- **Treasure**: Thanks to [Lightning][lightning], monetary value can be exchanged instantly without friction.
