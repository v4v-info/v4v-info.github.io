An increasing number of people are getting deplatformed from all kinds of
services. Whether you are booted off YouTube, banned from Twitter, kicked from
PayPal, or removed from the SWIFT network, the result is always the same:
someone in power doesn't want you to do a certain thing, which is why your
access to said thing is being denied.

Value4Value is an idea that builds upon protocols, not platforms. It is an
idea that connects people directly, in ways that can't be shut down, can't be
censored, can't be stopped. Open protocols and open standards allow for a
flourishing ecosystem of competing service providers, in addition to giving you
the option to do everything yourself.
